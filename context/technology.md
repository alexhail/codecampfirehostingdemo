# Technology Stack

- **Three.js** - Core 3D rendering library
- **JavaScript** - Programming language (vanilla JS, no TypeScript)
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Basic structure and styling
- **Vite** - Fast, modern frontend build tool and dev server
- **Git** - Version control

# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize project structure with Vite
2. Configure Vite for Three.js development
3. Create basic HTML entry point
4. Install Three.js and other dependencies

## Phase 2: Basic 3D Environment
1. Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
2. Implement basic lighting (ambient and directional)
3. Create a simple ground plane for the campground
4. Add camera controls for third-person perspective

## Phase 3: Player Character
1. Create or import a 3D model for the player character
2. Implement character movement (WASD controls)
3. Set up character animations (idle, walking)
4. Configure third-person camera to follow the player

## Phase 4: Campground Objects
1. Create or import 3D models for:
   - Fire pit
   - Table
   - Chair
2. Position objects in the campground scene
3. Implement basic collision detection

## Phase 5: Interactions
1. Add interaction system (raycasting for object selection)
2. Implement specific interactions:
   - Sitting in chair
   - Adding wood to fire
   - Items on table
3. Add visual feedback for interactive objects

## Phase 6: Polish
1. Add ambient sounds (crackling fire, nature sounds)
2. Implement day/night cycle
3. Add particle effects for fire
4. Create a simple UI for instructions
5. Optimize performance and fix bugs
